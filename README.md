# Oak Engine
## Overview:
Oak engine is small game engine aimed at being lightweight, fast and extensible that is still in very early stages. Oak engine uses modern c++ (currently c++14 with the use of nested namespaces) with lua as a scripting language, I plan to add bindings for javascript and possibly c# in the future. The engine is designed to use multi-threading at its core and will support vulkan to take full advantage of this.
